# FetchNSPasteboardItems

A macOS command line utility for printing the entire pasteboard contents in plist or JSON format.

I use this for debugging of my own clipboard tools such as [iClip](http://iclipapp.com).

I also made a GUI app for viewing the clipboard contents: [ShowClipboards](http://www.tempel.org/ShowClipboards)

See also [my other tools](http://apps.tempel.org).
